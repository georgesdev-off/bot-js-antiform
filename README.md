## How to Install

Take the bot token and put it in the <strong>config.js</strong>, in the place of 'your secret token'.
Then if you want to add owners, replace ids by the ids of owners.

Make sure you have version 16 of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

Then install node modules by opening a terminal and typing `npm i`. 

Now you can start the bot by typing `node index.js` in your terminal.
